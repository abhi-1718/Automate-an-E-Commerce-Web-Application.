Description:

Flipkart is an e-commerce platform, and they have launched a new feature to search for a product in a particular category. Once the product is searched, Flipkart displays it as a list of product items. To enhance the performance of the application, Flipkart has implemented lazy loading. It displays only a few products that can come on the screen.

To display or load more products, the user must scroll down.

As a Test Engineer, you are expected to test this feature end-to-end.
